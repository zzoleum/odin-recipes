   <h2>What is it?</h2>

   <p>Toast is bread that has been browned by radiant heat. The browning is the result of a Maillard reaction, altering the flavor of the bread and making it firmer so that it is easier to spread toppings on it.</p>

   <p>Toasting is a common method of making stale bread more palatable. Bread is often toasted using a toaster, but toaster ovens are also used. Pre-sliced bread is most commonly used.</p>
